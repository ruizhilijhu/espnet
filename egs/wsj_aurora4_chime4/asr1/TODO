TODO:
GOAL: tell if the dnn is working properly or not, --> binary question?

1. extract ctxenc and decstate, see the correlation
2. implement entropy (post), m-measure (post), ncca(any), and autoencoder(any) for comparison
3. see the prediction difference between features and decpresm
4. plot fbank, encout, ctcpresm, decpsm, ctcpost, dec-post for ??? utterance that my pm is good at but other pms are bad at?
5. how to conclude which PMs is good? teo varilbaes (scores v.s. wer)
6. decode only ctc and only decoder and see how much they contribute to cer and see if the alpha is also corealted with predicted CER from decpresm and ctcpresm
7. decode on some slightly corrupted data
